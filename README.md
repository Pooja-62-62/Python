# 🚗 Car Price Analysis – Missing Value Handling in Python

This project demonstrates how to handle missing values in a car price dataset using Python. It is a part of a data preprocessing workflow commonly used in machine learning and data analysis tasks.

## 📌 Project Objective

To identify, analyze, and treat missing values in a car dataset in order to prepare clean data for further analysis or modeling.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualizing missing values)

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about different car attributes like:
- Car Name
- Engine Type
- Horsepower
- Price
- ...and others

Some of these fields have missing values that affect model performance and data quality.

## 📁 Files in the Repository

- `CarPrice_MissingValue.ipynb`: Main notebook for data preprocessing, handling nulls, and summarizing data insights.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-missing-value.git
cd car-price-missing-value
```

2. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook CarPrice_MissingValue.ipynb
```

3. Follow along the notebook to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Detect missing values
   - Use techniques like `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`, or imputation strategies

## ✅ Key Concepts Covered

- Data Cleaning
- Handling Missing Values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (optional)
- Preparing data for machine learning
